The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. Here, we provide a guided tour of early developmental events in their electrophysiological context. We demonstrate the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells as being defined by functional changes that set up adult behavioral function. In a model organism such as C. elegans, this transition is developmentally conserved and well-characterized in various ways by publicly-available data. In this paper, we will build on an existing time-series model of neuronal differentiation and conduct a functional assessment of this developmental connectome. Multiple sources of data will be brought to bear on this effort, providing information about the emerging connectome as well as the emergence of functional subnetworks. A first-mover model of the emerging connectome is also introduced, which will help to synthesize the details of our results. The broader implications of these functional analyses will be considered, including implications for computational modeling and behavioral origins.
